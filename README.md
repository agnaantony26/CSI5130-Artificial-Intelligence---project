# CSI5130-Artificial-Intelligence---project
**Adaptive Prompt Optimization using Reinforcement Learning (RLHF-lite)**
 
 Overview of the Project: 
 Depending on how the input prompt is written, large language models (LLMs) such as Mistral and GPT-4 perform differently.  While poorly written prompts can result in misunderstandings or mistakes, well-written ones can inspire precise and imaginative answers.  The goal of this project is to develop an Adaptive Prompt Optimization system that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn how to make prompts better.  Beginning with a straightforward prompt, the system will assess the model's output quality and gradually learn to produce better prompts that produce better outcomes.  This project is RLHF-lite, a condensed, lightweight variant of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) intended for small-scale testing.
